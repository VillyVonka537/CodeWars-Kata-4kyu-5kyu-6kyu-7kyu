# This problem takes its name by arguably the most important event in the life of the 
# ancient historian Josephus: according to his tale, he and his 40 soldiers were 
# trapped in a cave by the Romans during a siege.

# Refusing to surrender to the enemy, they instead opted for mass suicide, with a 
# twist: they formed a circle and proceeded to kill one man every three, until one 
# last man was left (and that it was supposed to kill himself to end the act).

# Well, Josephus and another man were the last two and, as we now know every detail 
# of the story, you may have correctly guessed that they didn't exactly follow 
# through the original idea.

# You are now to create a function that returns a Josephus permutation, taking as 
# parameters the initial array/list of items to be permuted as if they were in a 
# circle and counted out every k places until none remained.

# Tips and notes: it helps to start counting from 1 up to n, instead of the usual 
# range 0..n-1; k will always be >=1.

# For example, with n=7 and k=3 josephus(7,3) should act this way.

# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence
# [1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out and goes into the result [3]
# [1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6]
# [1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2]
# [1,4,5] => 7 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7]
# [1,4] => 5 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7,5]
# [4] => 1 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7,5,1]
# [] => 4 is counted out and goes into the result [3,6,2,7,5,1,4]

# So our final result is:

# josephus([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],3)==[3,6,2,7,5,1,4]
