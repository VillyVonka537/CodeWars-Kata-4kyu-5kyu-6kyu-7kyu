# In this kata you have to correctly return who is the "survivor", ie: the last 
# element of a Josephus permutation.

# Basically you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and that they 
# are eliminated in steps of k elements, like this:

# josephus_survivor(7,3) => means 7 people in a circle;
# one every 3 is eliminated until one remains
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence
# [1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out
# [1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out
# [1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out
# [1,4,5] => 7 is counted out
# [1,4] => 5 is counted out
# [4] => 1 counted out, 4 is the last element - the survivor!

# The above link about the "base" kata description will give you a more thorough 
# insight about the origin of this kind of permutation, but basically that's all 
# that there is to know to solve this kata.

# Notes and tips: using the solution to the other kata to check your function may 
# be helpful, but as much larger numbers will be used, using an array/list to 
# compute the number of the survivor may be too slow; you may assume that both n 
# and k will always be >=1.
