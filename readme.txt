Welcome to the repository of my solutions!

For all Codewars tasks, I have a "dirty solution" and a "clean solution"
Almost always I publish only a “clean solution” - optimized for PEP8
and for the task itself, using "syntactic sugar".

But only in the "dirty solution" the whole essence of the problem is displayed. Often, only
with the help of such a solution, the meaning of the problem can be conveyed. Keep this in mind when
copy mine, someone else's solution and refer to it.
